show graph/metrics from saved model - do torch.load and ref dictionary:
   - epoch
   - model_state_dict
   - optimizer_state_dict
   - loss
   - loss_hist_train
   - loss_hist_valid

how to start from pre-trained data? - stop one early and resume.

does performance get better with more data?

can to_one_hot load data into a tensor directly?

do all at once

does GPU help?  it was quite a bit faster when the dataset was all in-memory.  
unable to use Cuda with MMEpdDataSet in its current form, because mmap.mmap cannot
be "pickled."  Potential solutions:
- use file based mmap - https://mmappickle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- split the input file into separate files containing one batch of records.  use
  a naming convention where the file name can be derived by an index.
  in the init, determine the number of files.  in getitem, read the file 
  by index.  


is the model optimal to approximate the eval function?

quantize for faster inference


approximate depth 1 search

add data:
* random openings
* FRC

NNUE for faster translation
