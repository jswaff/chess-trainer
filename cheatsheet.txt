use pgn-extract to extract 10% of positions from PGN into EPD file

   pgn-extract -Wepd test.pgn -s | grep "\S" | awk 'NR % 10 == 0' | awk '{gsub(/c0.*c1/,"c1")}1' > test.epd

sort file so common EPDs are together:

   sort infile > outfile

use epd_to_csv.py to convert format to CSV in score,result,FEN format.  purges games without clear result.

use calculate_win_rate.py to consolidate records with win ratios.  new format is score,w,d,l,fen

Label Files.  chess4j expects CSV files to be in score,<other fields>,fen format

   java -jar chess4j-6.1-uber.jar -native -mode label -depth 5 -csv in.csv -out out.csv


Before training:
 -- use clamp to filter out mate scores and clamp remaining scores
 -- randomize order: sort -R infile > outfile


----

use rearrange.py to put file in format expected by trainer: fen, score, wins, draws, losses


----

If necessary, split data

   split --number=l/4 infile prefix
